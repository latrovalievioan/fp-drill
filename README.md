# My FP journey

In this repo I'll explore the functional programming world.
<br>
The main resource I'll be using is [Web Village Voyage channel](https://www.youtube.com/@webvv/videos)
<br>
I've chosen this resource because as a TypeScript dev it will be easier for me to understand the concepts,
however I'll be writing everything in Haskell so that I can learn the language.
